# Project 1
##### Distance Calculation using an Ultrasonic Sensor - Unity's Cube Movement.
###### Related Files: *distanceCalcUSS.ino*, *cubeMovement.cs*.

## distanceCalcUSS.ino
**--> C++ code uploaded to the Arduino.**
* Uses an Ultrasonic Sensor (hc-sr04) to calculate a distance.
* Sends that distance to Unity.
* Switches on and off some LEDs depending on how great the distance is.

## cubeMovement.cs
**--> C Sharp script attached to a cube in Unity.**
* Receives distance from Arduino.
* Moves cube:
    * closer to the camera as the distance decreases.
    * further away from the camera as the distance increases.

# Project 2 (DUSHGRProject)
##### *D*ual *U*ltrasonic *S*ensor - *H*and *G*esture *R*ecognition *Project*
###### Related Files: *dUSHGR_Project.ino*.

## dUSHGR_Project.ino
**--> C++ code uploaded to the Arduino.**
* Uses two (Left and Right) Ultrasonic Sensors (hc-sr04) to calculate two distances and detect whether something (a human hand) is in front of left or right sensor.
* When something is detected in front of one sensor, it saves that information for a specific amount of time.
* By comparing the time that something was detected by each sensor, it can recognise left-to-right and right-to-left hand gestures.
